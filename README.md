# pys60-mcs
Music Composition System for S60 Symbian

Written entirely on the mobile device,
this is a system for generating synthesized
melodies, by exporting them to wavefiles.

It has been tested to work on Nokia N70,
which it was written on.

Main features are

* piano roll editor
* additive synthesizer
* format specifier
* full RIFF parser/encoder
* complete GUI (vanilla PyS60 framework)

You shall need PyS60 installed on the device.
It is still available from Ensymbian project.

Alternatively, you could compile it into "sis",
and install it as an unsigned binary.

It is not a finished project, but I would
like to revive it in the near future.

**Please consider this application was written *entirely* on a
mobile device (using editor called [Ped]; still available on Google code archive), 
and it follows that code 
documentation was *not a priority*.
Furthermore, due to limited screen space, the variable naming style had to be
as cryptic as possible. Sorry, not sorry. *That being said*, the code also had
to be short, so it is more likely to be *self explanatory***

The main script is called "mcs.py".

Feel free to use other modules as libraries
for your own projects, that is, if you're
interested in S60 development, or need
a way to create cool ringtones.
